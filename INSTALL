Before installing, you must have these modules installed:
PerlQt-2.103 compiled with Qt-1.4
OpenGL-0.5 compiled with some version of MesaGL

Look at Makefile.PL and make sure the values are reasonable. The QTDIR
environment variable should be properly set.

MISSING LIBRARIES ARE NOT HARMLESS!

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Good luck!
