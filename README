This module provides access to the Qt/OpenGL extensions from Perl.

Before installing, you must have these modules installed:
PerlQt-2.103 compiled with Qt-1.4
OpenGL-0.5 compiled with some version of MesaGL

Also, you must compile and install the Qt OpenGL extension. It will create
libqgl, which is required by this module.

Included is a nice spinning gears demo app to demonstrate its use.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions or bug-fixes,
please e-mail me, Ashley Winters, at jql@accessone.com.
